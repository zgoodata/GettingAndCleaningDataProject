# GettingAndCleaningDataProject

This repository is for the course project of the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course.

The repository contains:
1. `CookBook.md`, which describes the data and all summaries and transformations performed on the data
2. `run_analysis.R`, which transforms the original data set (see {{CookBook.md}}) and creates a new data set, which contains the averages of all the standard deviation and mean variable measurements for each subject and each activity.

The data used for project is wearable-computing data which is publicly available.
